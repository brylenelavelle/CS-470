This repo contains my self-reflection assignment for the CS 470 course, where I summarize the skills I learned in cloud-based development and describe my strengths as a software developer. I discuss my proficiency in cloud service concepts, serverless architecture, data modeling, and security. Additionally, I delve into planning for the future growth of my web application, exploring microservices and serverless options, handling scale and error handling, predicting costs, and evaluating the pros and cons of expansion. This reflection showcases my ability to think ahead and apply complex concepts to plan for scalability and elasticity in the cloud.
